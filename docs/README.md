# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with **HMR** and some **ESLint rules**. It is designed to serve as a foundation for building robust React applications with modern tooling.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- **@vitejs/plugin-react**: Uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
- **@vitejs/plugin-react-swc**: Uses SWC for Fast Refresh.
